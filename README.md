# skills

A personal collection of agent skills for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other harnesses that support the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format. The repository is also packaged as an [Agent Plugin](https://agent-plugins.org/) so compatible clients can discover the collection through the portable plugin standard.

The collection is intentionally small and opinionated. Each skill can be installed independently.

## Install

Install interactively with the Agent Skills CLI:

```sh
npx skills add perfectbase/skills
```

Install one skill globally:

```sh
npx skills add perfectbase/skills --skill grill-me --global
```

Or copy a skill manually into the skill directory used by your harness:

```sh
cp -R skills/grill-me ~/.agents/skills/
```

Common destinations include:

- Codex: `~/.agents/skills/`
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/`
- Cursor: `~/.agents/skills/` or `~/.cursor/skills/`

## Compatibility

The root [`plugin.json`](plugin.json) identifies this repository as an Agent Plugins 1.0 package. Compatible clients discover each immediate child of `skills/` as an independent skill.

Every skill directory is centered on a `SKILL.md`. A few skills retain harness-specific frontmatter where it controls invocation behavior. Optional Codex presentation and invocation settings live in `agents/openai.yaml`.

Run the repository checks with:

```sh
node scripts/check.mjs
```
